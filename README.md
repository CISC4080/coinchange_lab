# Lab3: coinchange_lab

In this lab, we solve different versions of the CoinChange problems, making use of recursive methods to explore all combinations. 


## Preparation: 
     Download the following starter code: coin_change.cpp

## Requirements:

1. Implement the  
3. Implement an unlimited coin change problem, where each coin can be used for an unlimited number of times. 

  Implement this function recursively, based upon the logic learnt in class (i.e., use decision tree to guide your design of the recursive algorithm). 


## Deadlines and Submission

Please submit your **coin_change.cpp** by Tuesday April 9th to the following submission link:
